# Gemcraft

(Mainly for multiplayer purposes)

This is a custom minecraft java plugin that modifies the game in a way that creates a new and unique experience for the player.

  Many modified minecraft mini-games already exist, one of them being "factions", where the general idea is factions fighting amongst each other and raiding bases through the use of explosives.
The Gemcraft plugin removes the use of explosives and instead adds a brand new and unique raiding concept that is much more interesting and strategic, by implementing custom raiding tools,
armor and weapons with power-ups that do not exist in the original game and can be bought through the use of "Gems".

To use this plugin, you would need a copy of the game and a locally created/or rented spigot server.
